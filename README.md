分析樂高資料，總共三個問題：
1. What percentage of all licensed sets ever released were Star Wars themed? 所有授權的資料裡，幾成是星際大戰主題的？
2. In which year was Star Wars not the most popular licensed theme (In terms of number of sets released that year)? 相較於同年的其他主題產品量，哪一年星際大戰不是最受歡迎的？
3. numbers of sets Released every year for Star Wars? 請問星際大戰每一年的產品量？
